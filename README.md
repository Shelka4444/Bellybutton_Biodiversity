# Bellybutton Biodiversity Project
A large sample of volunteer data was collected to assess bacterial species which may be the key to unlocking the process to manufacture synthetic beef. This website  visualizes the top 10 bacterial species found in each volunteer's belly buttons. Volunteers are identified by an id number which can be pulled up by the search panel. The panel will then display demographic information as well as a bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge to visually showcase the different types of bacteria tested. Follow the link for an interactive demonstration of the collected data for this project: [Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard](https://shelka4444.github.io/Bellybutton_Biodiversity/).
